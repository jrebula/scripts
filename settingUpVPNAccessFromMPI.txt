  instructions to proxy a browser into mpi are here:

  First email raffi:
  raffi.enficiaud@tue.mpg.de
  to ask for a proxy account

  Once you have account information, make sure the vpn is disconnected
  in chromium, go to settings, then advanced, then network settings, then network proxy...

  select auotmatic from the dropdown box, then paste in 
  http://isweb.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/proxy/proxy.pac

  hit "apply system wide"

  if you try to go to one of confluence pages above, your browser should ask for the proxy username and account
else
  install a virtual machine, download the vpn client there, login and access confluence from it. The real (non virtual) OS is where you can access deurer and install SL and such, the virtual machine just lets you read the wiki

end

in the confluence wiki, navigate to: code base -> getting started

Read anything and go through any tutorials you think will be useful to you.
